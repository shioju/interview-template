# interview-template
This is the template for a pair programming interview using javascript and jasmine.

## Getting started
Candidate's code should go into `code.js` and tests should go into `spec.js`.

## Running the tests
To run the tests, just open `jasmine\SpecRunner.html` in the browser.

## Displaying output
To display output from the candidate's code, one way is to call functions in `code.js` from `index.html` and updating the page accordingly.
